Hello! I am a research assistant at Case Western Reserve University, working in the [Burberry Lab](https://burberrylab.org/) in the Department of Pathology. I am primarily interested in applications of computational biology and bioinformatics to neuroscience research. I am currently in the application process for M.D./Ph.D. programs, in which I plan to pursue clinical research in neurology.
